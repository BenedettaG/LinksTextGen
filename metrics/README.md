# Metrics
1.     In order to calculate the BLEU score of the captions generated by the model,it is possible use the ctrlBLEU notebook that we have used on Google Colab. The notebook needs as input two txt files: candidate (generated captions) and reference. The ctrlBLEU notebook produces the file metrics_evaluation.txt that contains the score of BLEU, Self-BLEU and POS-BLEU calculated on the provided texts.
2.      Other_metrics.ipynb contains some functions that we used to make quantitative evaluations.
3.      Barchart_generation_parameters.ipynb contains the code to generate plots.
