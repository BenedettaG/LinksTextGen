# How to use
In this folder we can find the Colab python notebook that we used to split the COCO dataset 2017 into supercategories.
<br> To download the COCO dataset you can visit: https://cocodataset.org/#download

<br> This operation must be done for both training set (captions_train2017.json and instances_train2017.json) and for test set (captions_val2017.json and instances_val2017.json).
